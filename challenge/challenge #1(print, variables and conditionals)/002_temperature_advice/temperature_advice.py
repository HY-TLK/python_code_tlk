# Ask the user to enter the current temperature (in Celsius).
print("Hi! Here is the temperature advice!")
# Store the temperature in a variable.
tem_input = float(input("please enter the temperature in Celsius: "))


# Use conditional statements to give advice based on the temperature.

# If the temperature is below 10째C, print: `"It's cold outside. Wear a jacket!"`
if tem_input < 10:
    print(f"Oh! It's {tem_input} degrees. It's cold outside! wear a jacket!")

# If the temperature is between 10째C and 25째C, print: `"It's a nice day. Wear short-sleeves!"`
elif 10 < tem_input < 25:
    print(f" It's {tem_input} degrees.it's a nice day! wear short sleeves!")

# If the temperature is above 25째C, print: `"It's hot outside. Stay cool!"`
elif tem_input > 25:
    print(f" It's {tem_input} degrees. It's hot outside! stay cool!")
